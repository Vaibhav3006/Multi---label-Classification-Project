# Multi-label Classification Project
This is a repository on my multi label classification project on the Costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction dataset.

You can find the dataset here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction

This dataset has very high dimensionality with 143 different columns.
It is a multi-label classification problem with 4 labels:
1.	Extereme Poverty
2.	Vulnerable
3.	Moderate Poverty
4. NonVulnerable

It is also an instance of imbalanced classes due to a skew towrds the 4th label, i.e. the NonVulnerable class as is evident from the following graphic:
