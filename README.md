# Multi-label Classification Project
This is a repository on my multi label classification project on the Costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction dataset where we have to predict the hoursehold type of the families based on a select set of features.

You can find the dataset here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction

This dataset has very high dimensionality with 143 different columns.
It is a multi-label classification problem with 4 labels:
1.	Extereme Poverty
2.	Vulnerable
3.	Moderate Poverty
4. NonVulnerable

It is also **an instance of imbalanced classes** due to a skew towrds the 4th label, i.e. the NonVulnerable class as is evident from the following graphic:
